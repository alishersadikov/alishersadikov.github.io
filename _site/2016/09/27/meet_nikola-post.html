<h1>Meet Nikola</h1>
<p>September 27, 2016</p>
<p>Let us talk about the greenest truck out there: <em><strong>Nikola</strong></em>!</p>

<p>Here is a picture of her:</p>

<p><em>95% EFFICIENT ELECTRIC MOTORS</em> - The custom electric motors of the Nikola One™ operate at 95% efficiency, so when it comes to hills they are quicker
going up and saving money going down. While other trucks are losing energy and riding their brakes, Nikola One™ is capturing energy and saving its brakes,
minimizing noice and cost.</p>

<p><em>UNOBSTRUCTED MID-CAB ENTRY</em> - A standard class 8 truck requires the driver to climb up and into the vehicle at the front of the cab where his entry
is obstructed by the seat and the steering wheel. This awkward action of climbing in and out is repeated several times a day. With the mid-cab entry design of
the Nikola One™, the driver simply and safely walks straight into the cab and then up between the front seat to access the cockpit, much like an airplane.</p>
